The annual CornCon conference was held Sept 10-11, 2021 and the Crypto Challenge CTF featured challenges that could all 
be done in a remote fashion, allowing for a great opportunity for SecDSM members to participate in the conference 
remotely.

There were a total of 10 challenges presented, which followed the CornCon 7 theme of "Cyber Things", a pun/spin off of 
the popular Netflix series, Stranger Things.

Themes are important. So is remembering where you came from.
What was the slogan / subtitle for Children of CornCon IV?
```
### Solution
#### Context
Knowing that "Children of CornCon" is the title for CornCon's `kids` conference, this was more of an issue of figuring 
out which year was CornCon 4 and finding some references to the kids track.  CornCon being well known for their movie 
based themes each year, I assumed the subtitle would be in some marketing material from the year. 

#### Finding the Answer
So, being that 2021 was CornCon 7, CornCon 4 would have been 2018, so I headed over the 
[2018 Kids Schedule](https://corncon.net/2018.corncon.kids.agenda.html) on the official CornCon website, and came up 
empty handed.   

Finally, I headed over to twitter and looking for tweets from the 2018 timeframe, I came across 
[a tweet from @MrJeffMan](https://twitter.com/MrJeffMan/status/1021762902334816259?s=20) which contained a subtitle 
`Harry Hack and the Coblet of Cyber` which was the solution

### Side Track
I actually found a challenge coin from this year for sale on

Our sensor network detected an anomalous power surge at 1500. We were able to calculate the source to a location just behind Hawkins Library.

Please use the data to help us calculate where the power spike occurred at 0330.

We recovered this file from the remains of the lab, but it appears incomplete.

Maybe you can fix it and help us solve the mystery.
