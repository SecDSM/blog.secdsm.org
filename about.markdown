Founded in Feb of 2016, SecDSM is a citysec based in Des Moines, IA. The mission of SecDSM is to provide a free, vendor-neutral forum for the expansion and dissemination of industry knowledge, to extend the culture of security awareness, and enable members to make informed, and educated security decisions. SecDSM runs on attendee participation. If you've built, broken, or discovered something cool, please consider sharing with the group. The usual meeting format consists of an introduction, one or more tool talks, and then one or more primary talks. Please reach out via our Slack channel if you have an idea for a presentation you would like to give!
